## Quadratic Voting 

Quoting from "Quadratic Voting: How Mechanism Design Can Radicalize Democracy"(2017): _Quadratic voting is a collective decision-making procedure which involves individuals allocating votes to express the degree of their preferences, rather than just the direction of their preferences._ It is often considered an innovative improvement of the traditional 1-person-1-vote scheme and, as doing so, it can address issues like majority rule.  

The simplofied formular is:
```
cost of the voter = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + number of votes MATIC
```

Auadratic voting hugely promote the development of hackathon topic selection and prize allocation. With it, community contributors can vote for their favourite topics and/or projects and emphasize their preference with multiple votes. Along with increased cost, of course:-)   

Currently, you can use platforms like [gitcoin][gitcoin] and [hackerlink][hackerlink] to hold your votes. While [gitcoin][gitcoin] only takes to their own events and [hackerlink][hackerlink] is open to everyone with reasonable application.



## Voting in A Hackathon 

This is the a critical part of a hackathon with prizes. We list three frequently used ways as following and you are welcomed to add your own ideas:

|              | Description                                                                                                                                      | Pros                                                                                                                                                   | Cons                                                               |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Judges vote  | Limited number of judges will decide the prizes.                                                                                                 | Straightforward and easy to compute.                                                                                                                   | The final decision could be controversial.                         |
| Hackers vote | Every participant will get a ticket to vote for their favorite projects and the allocation of the final prize would depend on the tickets count. | This final decision would be decentralized and diversified, and the more teams would be able to share the final prize.                                 | Fraud and collude could happen.                                    |
| Open vote    | Let almost everyone to vote. We strongly suggest you to use quadratic voting in this case.                                                       | Except for all the advantages of hackers vote, this can provide greater chance to expose the projects and can further expand the impact of your event. | You need a platform to hold this vote. |
