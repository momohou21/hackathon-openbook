## Quadratic Voting 

TBD

## Voting in A Hackathon 

This is the most critical part of a hackathon and we find most of the current hackathons are using the following three ways to decide the prize allocation and please notice you can always combine them depending on your own case:

- **Judges vote** - limited number of judges will decide the prizes. This is the most traditional and direct way, yet the final decision could be controversial.
- **Hackers vote** - every participant will get a ticket to vote for their favorite projects and the allocation of the final prize would depend on the tickets count.
    - Pros - This final decision would be decentralized and diversified, and the more teams would be able to share the final prize.
    - Cons - Fraud and collude could happen.
- **Community vote** - let almost everyone vote. In this case suggest you to quadratic voting to prevent fraud.
    - Pros - Except for all the advantages of hackers vote, this can provide greater chance to expose the projects and can further expand the impact of your event.
    - Cons - You need a platform like gitcoin and hackerlink to hold this vote.
