# Before the Hack

## 1.Key Steps to Prepare a Hackathon

The preparation work can be really flexible according to your own event scale and goals.But the aim of the whole planning should be focusing on engaging and equipping the hackers to hack. A project tracker format can be found here, please feel free to make a copy and use for your upcoming hacks.

- Step 1  - lock down your topic, location(online or offline), target participants.
- Step 2 - determine your budget and contact potential partners and sponsors according to your decisions in step 1.
- Step 3 - confirm with all third-parties and lock down all communication materials (both online and offline).
- Step 4 - promoting your events and prepare offline logstics.
- Step 5 - the real hack day(s) and follow up.


## 2.Topic

One of the most important thing for a hackathon is its topic and it can impact all the downstream preparation effort. With a clear and specific theme, you can decide your target participants and potential partners to approach, customize all the details like location, time, prize, promotion channel, etc. 


## 3.Site - offline or virtual

For a **offline** hack, the minimum requirement of the venue would be fast and stable internet, and other setups from decoration to furnitures are totally depend on your budget. 

- Pros
    - Irreplaceable experience of communicating and developing.
- Cons
    - Complex logistics.
    - Limited by physical location and time.

For a **virtual** hack, all you need is a solid online platform for project submission and voting, and probably also a online meeting room for your opening and final demo show.

- Pros
    - Does not restricted by physical location.
    - Can last for a comparable longer period of time.
    - No need for complicated logistics.
- Cons
    - Not friendly for in individual hackers if no proper way provided to team up.
    

## 4.Communication and Publicity

Before preparing any materials, you have to determine **who is your target participants** based on your topic and location. And then we suggest you to use ‚Äúparticipants = channel x conversion rate‚Äù to estimate your final participants. 

Even though you may think promotion materials like poster and content scripts are critical for participant recruiting, promotion channels matters the most to attract the right participants. Here are several tips can help you get more proper participants to your event:

- The main message you want to deliver include location, time, topic, requirements for the participants, prize, partners, mentors and judges.
- Make sure your register entry is obvious and simple.
- Connect with locale developer communities and let them help
- Let the hackers that already registered to refer others
- Hold related warm-up workshops or prepare some learning resources can be a good way to attractive high quality participants.
- Good poster and slogan help.
- Influential mentors or judges help.
- More to come...üíª

Plus, a good register questionnaire can help you better understand, engaging and manage your participants. You can also do some preliminary screening before the real hack based on your preference. A simple format can be reached here.


## 5.Partners

Partners are totally optional for most of the hacks. Yet, holding a hackathon with the right partner might better equip the participants to deliver more valuable and interesting results. For example, you may need **local developer community** to promote your event, or some experienced experts to join as **mentors or judges**, or an **entity** to fund your reward, or a cloud service platform to **provide** solid and secure computing **service**, or a **food and accommondation supplier**, etc. 

We find HackathonDAO as a quite focused and professional sponsor, where they not only provide fund ($100,000 in total) for hackathon organizers, but also maintain a active community for hackathon organizers and volunteers. 

We are actively maintaining a listüíª of global potential partners of a hackathon event and you are more than welcomed to share you and your previous partner here if allowed and available.


# On the Hack

## 1.Team up

As mentioned above, it‚Äôs better to let the participants to know each other and exchange ideas before the real hack day. Useful tools includes Discord, Slack, Telegram, ect. We currently haven‚Äôt found a very efficient way for this and you are more than welcomed to add your own thoughts.üíª

If you find some of your participants are still not teamed up on the hack day, you can **1)** hold a open-mic and let encourage those who already have their own idea to recruit teammates and **2)** hold a corner for those individuals contributed to talk. These can be used for both online and offline events. 

 
## 2.Projects Submission & Demo

The final demo show is usually the most interesting and exciting part of the whole event, yet it‚Äôs also the part that most likely to get into embarrassment and chaos. Here are some tips for youÔºö

- Set a clear time limit (3-5mins per project) with a obvious timer visible for both the project owner, judges and all the participants.
- Always let the participants to clarify what‚Äôs the incremental change during the hackathon as some of the teams would use their previous projects.
- Encourage them to show live demo instead of slides.
- Hold a small demo faire after the demo show if you have 20+ projects.
- For the online hacks, we see a lot hacks using YouTube + Zoom (or other alternatives) to do the final demo and we believe this is a convenient way to do it and can also make it vey simple for projects follow-ups.
- Platforms like hackerlink provide very convenient tool for projects submission.
- More to come...üíª


## 3.Voting and Awards

This is the most critical part of a hackathon and we find most of the current hackathons are using the following three ways to decide the prize allocation and please notice you can always combine them depending on your own case:

- **Judges vote** - limited number of judges will decide the prizes. This is the most traditional and direct way, yet the final decision could be controversial.
- **Hackers vote** - every participant will get a ticket to vote for their favorite projects and the allocation of the final prize would depend on the tickets count.
    - Pros - This final decision would be decentralized and diversified, and the more teams would be able to share the final prize.
    - Cons - Fraud and collude could happen.
- **Community vote** - let almost everyone vote. In this case suggest you to quadratic voting to prevent fraud.
    - Pros - Except for all the advantages of hackers vote, this can provide greater chance to expose the projects and can further expand the impact of your event.
    - Cons - You need a platform like gitcoin and hackerlink to hold this vote.


## 4.Further Improve Your Hacking Experience

Every hackathon owners would have tons of advices and tips for you to further improve the hacking experience. Some of them are listed as below and you are more than welcomed to add more!!

- From @Penny (Dorahacks) - If you have 120+ participants, you can consider hold the hack in several separate venues.
- From @Penny (Dorahacks) - A countdown timer would increase the sense of competitiveness.
- From @Momo (Individual) - Water is necessary. And try to take care of people with different eating habits like vegan if food is covered.
- Party/Beer
- Workshop

# After the Hack

Participants and projects are both valuable outcomes of a hackathon. However, we find most of the events neglect this step and miss this great opportunity to expand their own community or fail to develop a prototyping project into a established product. 

Thus, we invite all the global organizers to share their own event results here.üíª Each folder may or may not include their own contact, participants info, final projects and preparation kits. This can help the all the sebsequent organizers and would bring more opportunities for the  participants as well.
