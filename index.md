This is a open-source manual activly maintained by global hackers and hackathon organizers. We are trying to capture almost everything you need to know or want to discuss about hackathons here.


## üíªWhat is a hackathon (We Believe...)

Hackathon is a kind of events that gather people (mostly hackers) to ‚Äúhack‚Äù on certain topics under an intensive time constrain, where the final projects are not necessarily refined and concept-proving prototypes are totally acceptable. As a way of inspiring and innovating, hackathon is quite flexible. Almost everything can be the topic and we have seen lots of great hacks in developer communities, schools and companies, like:

- **technical** hacks on blockchain, cyber security, IOT, Web 3.0, ect;
- **cross-disciplined** hacks on wearable devices, art installations, rural education, ect;
- **fun** hacks on Holloween, Mario games, ect;


## ‚öôÔ∏èThe Goal of a Hackathon

With the flexibility of the hackathon, the goal of a single hackathon is quite diversified. The most commonly mentioned targets are **to build** and **to communicate**.

- **To Build** - Some of the hacks intent to discuss or resolve specific problems, like cyber security, Web 3.0, IOT and so on, where we see a lot of brilliant ideas and prototypes and some later grow into valuable companies and products. 
- **To communicate** - Hackathons can also serve as a way of gathering talents and communication. For those innovative and passionate participants with strong technical skills, this kind of events provide them a great opportunity to show themselves or their projects, exchange ideas, make friends and find partners.
