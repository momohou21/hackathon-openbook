## üíªWhat is a hackathon (we believe...)

Hackathon is a kind of events that gather people (mostly hackers) to ‚Äúhack‚Äù on certain topics under an intensive time constrain, where the final projects are not necessarily refined and concept-proving prototypes are totally acceptable. As a way of inspiring and innovating, hackathon is quite flexible and almost everything can be the topic and we have seen lots of great hacks in developer communities, schools and companies, like:

- **technical** hacks on blockchain, cyber security, IOT, Web 3.0, ect;
- **cross-disciplined** hacks on wearable devices, art installations, rural education, ect;
- **fun** hacks on Holloween, Mario games, ect;


## ‚öôÔ∏èThe Goal of a Hackathon

With the flexibility of the hackathon, the goal of a single hackathon is quite diversified. The most commonly mentioned targets are **to build** and **to communicate**.

- **To Build** - Some hacks intent to discuss or resolve specific problems, like cyber security contest, Web 3.0 applications, repo bug fixing and so on, where we see a lot of brilliant ideas and prototypes and some later grow into valuable companies and/or products. 
- **To communicate** - Hackathons can also serve as a way of gathering talents and communicating. For those innovative and passionate participants with strong technical skills, this kind of events provide them great opportunities to show themselves or their projects, exchange ideas, make friends and find partners.
